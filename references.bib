  year = {1998},

  pages = {55-66},
  abstract = {We consider the problem of scheduling n independent jobs on m identical
	machines that operate in parallel. Each job has a controllable processing
	time. The fact that the jobs have a controllable processing time
	means that it is allowed to compress (a part of) the processing time
	of the job, in return for compression cost. We present the first
	known polynomial time approximation schemes for the non-preemptive
	case of several identical parallel machines scheduling problems with
	controllable processing times. Moreover, we study the problem when
	preemption is allowed and describe efficient exact and approximation
	algorithms.
	
	
	Scope and purpose
	
	
	Most classical scheduling models assume fixed processing times for
	the jobs. However, in real-life applications the processing time
	of a job often depends on the amount of resources such as facilities,
	manpower, funds, etc. allocated to it, and so the processing time
	can be reduced when additional resources are given to the job. This
	speed up of the processing time of a job comes at a certain cost.
	A scheduling problem in which the processing times of the jobs can
	be reduced at some expense is called a scheduling problem with controllable
	processing times. We contribute by presenting new approximation algorithms
	for this kind of problems.},

  abstract = {{This book's introduction features a humorous story of a man with
	a line of people behind him, who explains to his boss, "I can't find
	an efficient algorithm, but neither can all these famous people."
	This man illustrates an important quality of a class of problems,
	namely, the NP-complete problems: if you can prove that a problem
	is in this class, then it has no known polynomial-time solution that
	is guaranteed to work in general. This quality implies that the problem
	is difficult to deal with in practice.<p> The focus of this book
	is to teach the reader how to identify, deal with, and understand
	the essence of NP-complete problems; <I>Computers and Intractability</I>
	does all of those things effectively. In a readable yet mathematically
	rigorous manner, the book covers topics such as how to prove that
	a given problem is NP-complete and how to cope with NP-complete problems.
	(There is even a chapter on advanced topics, with numerous references.)
	<I>Computers and Intractability</I> also contains a list of more
	than 300 problems--most of which are known to be NP-complete--with

abstract="Constraint programming based column generation is a hybrid optimization framework recently proposed (Junker et al., 1999) that uses constraint programming to solve column generation subproblems. In the past, this framework has been used to solve scheduling problems where the associated graph is naturally acyclic and has done so very efficiently. This paper attempts to solve problems whose graph is cyclic by nature, such as routing problems, by solving the elementary shortest path problem with constraint programming. We also introduce new redundant constraints which can be useful in the general framework. The experimental results are comparable to those of the similar method in the literature (Desrochers, Desrosiers, and Solomon, 1992) but the proposed method yields a much more flexible approach.",
